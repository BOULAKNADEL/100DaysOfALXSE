# C++ Problem Solving

Throughout the #100DaysOfALXSE challenge, I've learned a great deal about problem-solving in C++. Each problem tackled has not only improved my coding skills but also enhanced my logical thinking and algorithmic approach. This challenge has been an integral part of my growth as a developer.

I've solved these problems based on the guidance and tutorials from **Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**.

## Problem Descriptions

1. Problem 1: [calculate the average of the marks]
2. Problem 2: [Max of two numbers]
3. problem 3: [Max of three numbers]
4. problem 4: [Swap two numbers]
5. problem 5: [Rectangle Area]
6. problem 6: [Recatngle Area Diagonal Side]
7. problem 7: [Triangle Area]
8. problem 8: [Circle Area]
9. problem 9: [Circle Area Diameter]
10. Problem 10: [Circle Area Inscribed In Square]

**Special Thanks to Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud for the invaluable guidance!** ðŸ™Œ
