# C++ Problem Solving

Throughout the #100DaysOfALXSE challenge, I've learned a great deal about problem-solving in C++. Each problem tackled has not only improved my coding skills but also enhanced my logical thinking and algorithmic approach. This challenge has been an integral part of my growth as a developer.

I've solved these problems based on the guidance and tutorials from **Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**.

## Problem Descriptions

1.  Problem  1: [Palindrome Array]
2.  Problem  2: [Count Odd Numbers In Array]
3.  problem  3: [Count Even Numbers In Array]
4.  problem  4: [Count Positive Number In Array]
5.  problem  5: [Count Negative Numbers]
6.  problem  6: [Recode abs built-in function in c++]
7.  problem  7: [Recode round built-in function in c++]
8.  problem  8: [Recode floor built-in function in c++]
9.  problem  9: [Recode ceil built-in function in c++]
10. Problem 10: [Recode sqrt built-in function in c++]

**Special Thanks to Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud (@ProgrammingAdvices) for the invaluable guidance!** ðŸ™Œ
