# C++ Problem Solving

Throughout the #100DaysOfALXSE challenge, I've learned a great deal about problem-solving in C++. Each problem tackled has not only improved my coding skills but also enhanced my logical thinking and algorithmic approach. This challenge has been an integral part of my growth as a developer.

I've solved these problems based on the guidance and tutorials from **Mohammed Abu-Hadhoud**.

## Problem Descriptions

1.  Problem  1: [Shuffle Array]
2.  Problem  2: [Copy Array In Reverse]
3.  problem  3: [Array Of Keys]
4.  problem  4: [Search Of Number In Array]
5.  problem  5: [Number In Array Or Not?]
6.  problem  6: [Dynamic Array]
7.  problem  7: [Copy Array using Add Function]
8.  problem  8: [Copy Odd Number To Array]
9.  problem  9: [Copy Prime Number To Array]
10. Problem 10: [Copy Distinct Number To Array]
